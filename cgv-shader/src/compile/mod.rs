pub trait Context<ModuleType: Module>
{
	/// Replace the currently active [`compile::Environment`] with the given one (or `None`).
	///
	/// Note that the environment is *moved* in. The caller *must* lose ownership of the environment because of the
	/// complex uniqueness semantics of compile environments (which are required for sane [merge](Environment::merge)
	/// operations): compiling shader code with an active environment will typically *alter* said environment. It would
	/// be problematic if the caller then retains a copy of the environment that claims to be identical to the one that
	/// underwent unknown changes inside the `compile::Context`.
	///
	/// If the caller wants to do other things with the environment after it plugged it into a `compile::Context`, it
	/// can retrieve it again by passing `None` to this method (or more expressively, via the shorthand
	/// [`compile::Context::takeEnvironment`]). This will retake ownership and leave the `compile::Context` without an
	/// active environment.
	///
	/// If the context's sole purpose was to work on an environment, then clients can also reclaim it via
	/// [`compile::Context::finishEnvironment`]. This will consume and thus "end" the context, avoiding the potentially
	/// expensive re-initialization for a new/blank environment that some implementations might need to perform.
	///
	/// **Note**: setting a [`compile::Environment`] could involve potentially expensive re-initialization as well as
	/// (re-)compiling the contained [`compile::Module`]s for the new context, which can be a very expensive operation,
	/// so clients should try to minimize moving environments in and out of contexts.
	///
	/// # Arguments
	///
	/// * `environment` â€“ The compile environment to replace the current one with.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// The previous environment if `Ok`, otherwise a [`SetEnvironmentError`] describing the problem.

	/// Take the current [`compile::Environment`] out of the context, leaving `None` in its place.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// `Some` previous environment if there was one, `None` otherwise.
	///
	/// # Panics
	///
	/// Not under normal circumstances, but a faulty implementation of `compile::Context` might return an error when
	/// [replacing]() the current environment with `None` (which should be guaranteed to succeed) and cause this method
	/// to panic.
